# pit

Pit is an excersize project given by Shutterfly.
All code documentation is added in the project itself. 
I've given alot of antention to memory issues. Iterate array as less as posible and swich only known indexes. 
I've tried draw only the delta part of canvas (the changes happening on the Motionevent.OnMove) and not draw whole canvas each time it is called.
I will be glad to answer any qustion about the logic or the development proccess.
It was a very interesting excercize.
Thanks.
Ittai.
